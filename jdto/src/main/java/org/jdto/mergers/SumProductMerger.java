/**
 * Covers some typical case when you wish to make a sum of the result of a product. <br />
 * 
 * If you could picture this as if was an SQL query, it will look like the following expression: <br />
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     select sum(a * b * c) from mytable as collection. 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * if it is configured like the following way: <br />
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * &#64;Source(value="collection", merger=SumProductMerger.class, mergerParams={"a","b","c"}
 * private double resultHolder;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This is a really typical case specially when dealing with bills which can
 * contain a price, an amount and a tax factor: <br />
 * 
 * <ul><li>
 * sum(itemPrice * itemAmount * taxFactor) <br />
 * </li></ul>
 * But it can be applied on other situations as well.
