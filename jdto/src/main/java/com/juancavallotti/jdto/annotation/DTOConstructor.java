/**
 * Use the annotated constructor to build the DTO instance. When used over a
 * default constructor (or when a default constructor is present in the class), 
 * this annotation will be ignored. If there are two or more constructors on the
 * class with this annotation present, then the first one found with the annotation
 * will be used.<br />
 * 
 * This annotation is only used to know which constructor to use so if the class
 * has only one constructor, then it doesn't need to be annotated. <br />
 * 
 * When using this feature you must annotate all of the constructor arguments
 * with &#64;{@link Source} or &#64;{@link Sources} because there's no nice
 * way of reading this information by reflection.
